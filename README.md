This project is like a stack overflow for prompt engineering. where prompt engineers can create, pull, update and most importntly SHARE prompts with other prompt engineers. Fostring learning, collaboration, community and career growth.

## My Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project is the number of growing need for technical know-how regarding LLMs, especially those who have taken on the AI-CE program with ALX.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
